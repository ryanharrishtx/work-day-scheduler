# Work Day Scheduler
This is a Work Day Scheduler built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When you open the scheduler, you are presented with time blocks for the hours between 9am and 5pm. Based on the hour in the day, the color of the time blocks will change. If it is a past time, the block will be gray, if it is the present hour, it will be red, and if it's a future hour, it will be green. When you click into a block, you are able to put in something that you want to save in that time block, and after you hit the save button it will stay in local storage so it will persist after refresh. Below are the User Story and Acceptance Criteria:
